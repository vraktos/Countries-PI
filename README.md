# Countries-PI
My individual project 

# What is Countries-PI about? This project is a SPA with a backend service. This was an exiting 
  project because I was able to put to use all my knowledge about Front-End and Back-End. 
# What features does Countries-PI has?  It has a database where I storage all countries's information. This data is fetched from https://restcountries.com/.
  once I've fetched this data I display it in the main page in groups of 10 countries. This page has a few combined filters so you can search for specific countries 
  or countries' information. It also has a "create" feature where the user can create an adventure and then is associated to specific countries, this adventure is 
  later displayed in the "Detail" page of the selected countries.
 #Which technologies did I use? All the project is made with JavaScript. Front-End is made with React.js and styled with CSS modules. States are managed by Redux.js.
                                Back-End is made with Express in Node.js env. The DB was made with PostgreSQL and the ORM was Sequelize.
